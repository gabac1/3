## Election-Audit Summary
This code, with some modifications, can be used on counting other elections as well. For example, this code can be used to count similar elections in other precincts across the state. This code can also be used on senate elections. If the formating of the data of other elections are different (e.g., in xlsx instead of csv), the read-in functionality part of the code should be adjusted to the corresponding data. Furthermore, if all standards (i.e., how each column of the data is named, in what order the columns are, etc. ) of data documentation across the state are known, a part of code can be added to identify the standard used and rearrange the data into a common format which can be taken as input for the rest of the code.
